## Anagram
#### A program that finds anagrams.
### How to build the program!!
#### To build the program we need a function for sorting the words in alphabetic order. After that we can read from the file `simple.txt` and put in a `HashMap` the keyword and the anagram group of words. Finally, we can use a `foreach` loop to iterate through that `HashMap` and write in another file `anagrams.txt` the anagram words. 
#### To run the program, we need to have a file named `simple.txt` with some words inside, otherwise we will get an empty output file.
